Proposed Strict Session Policy:

Issue: 
Currently, once logged in, the session remains valid even after visiting other pages. 
The user wants to FORCE re-login when navigating back from `/public` to `/`.

Fix:
- In `wcp_nicegui_mobile.py`, explicitly **logout** the user when they enter the public page.
- Action: Set `app.storage.user['authenticated'] = False` inside `public_page()`.

Effect:
1. User logs in at `/` -> Authenticated = True.
2. User goes to `/public` -> Authenticated becomes False.
3. User manually goes back to `/` -> `admin_page` checks Authenticated (False) -> Prompts for Login.

Code Changes:
- `wcp_nicegui_mobile.py`:
  - Import `app` from `nicegui`.
  - Add `app.storage.user['authenticated'] = False` at the start of `public_page`.
